      "I used an FPGA and GPU to reduce the time taken for 4D MRI reconstruction, with the fourth dimension being in time, using a pre-existing algorithm: XD-GRASP.",
      "In addition to a proposed XD-GRASP implementation, I explored the requirements for bridging the gap between the reconstruction time I achieved (around 24 minutes for the specific data dimensions) and real-time reconstruction."
