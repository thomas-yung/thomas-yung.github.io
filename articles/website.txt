When building a personal website, I believe it is important to balance simplicity with a demonstration of the creator's ability. My objective was to make a clean, accessible website to provide a platform for me to showcase any projects I had, both in music and programming.

The initial screen was designed to be minimal, as to not overload any viewers with information. Beyond the positioning, which seemed obvious for a page with little content, the only choices to make were in fonts and colour which are down to a subjective decision. The four menu options expand or change sections and ensure that only one section is expanded at any given time.

I avoided the convenience of using a <i>Javascript</i> library such as <i>jQuery</i> because I found more use in building experience in the language itself. Having been taught <i>Java</i> at <a href=”https://www.imperial.ac.uk” target=”_blank”>university</a> and I have had lots of experience using the language. Naturally I found the transition between the languages relatively simple as the syntax is very similar and my aims could be completed without having to encounter many new concepts. Fortunately the language is well documented online and there is a wealth of resources and forums to learn from.

In order to ensure only one section would be open at any given time, I had to keep track of the expanded section,something which also helped with toggling the expansion of section rather than only opening upon a click. Following this it was simple to write the code that would handle sections opening and closing and also the lines above the menu option (which remain visible for the open section).
